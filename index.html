            <h2>Skillset</h2>
            <p>My skillset is definitely geared more to development over design. My recent skills are more based around WordPress - mainly using/building custom bespoke themes.</p>

                    <p>
                        Vizulate represents my first true 'developer' role, where I've faced challenges that have elevated my skills and deepened my understanding of web development. This experience has not only expanded my technical abilities but also significantly enhanced my teamwork and problem-solving skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time here, my primary responsibility has been collaborating with the Senior Developer and Design Team on both existing and new site builds. This involves creating streamlined and efficient processes to accelerate development and ensure customer satisfaction, as well as developing methods to expedite future projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the company's needs, I've focused heavily on WordPress development, which has greatly expanded my expertise in this area.

                        My first dive into web development was with LSi Ltd, where I worked closely with a Senior Web Designer in a small team of two. Together, we managed all internal websites and implemented automations across the company to streamline various processes.

                    <p>
                        My work included brief stints on small internal websites and assisting the senior developer with large client projects, primarily using Laravel and WordPress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While my job title suggested a design-focused role, my responsibilities were diverse. Ultimately, I sought a position where I could fully concentrate on web development, allowing me to advance my skills and focus exclusively on this area.

                        Throughout my employment, I've independently developed several websites, with some of my more recent projects still live today. I'm fully capable of managing a client website from concept to completion.

                    <p>
                        My primary objective in taking on these projects was to advance my skillset. The absence of strict deadlines allowed me the freedom to explore and experiment with different technologies, further enhancing my expertise.

            <h2>Hobbies, General Achievements & About Me</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I have a close-knit group of friends that I've known for years, and we regularly get together for meals, game nights, and other activities. While many of my friends would describe me as an extrovert, I also value my alone time, making me something of an introverted extrovert - a combination that might sound unusual but works perfectly for me.</p>
            <p>Mathematics was almost my chosen career path. During high school, I participated in several national mathematics competitions, where only a select few students - and even some teachers - were entered. Over the years, I consistently ranked as the top student, even surpassing the teachers by the end of my school years. I've always had a logical mind and believe I approach problems from a unique perspective</p>
            <p>I was also voted as 'Mr Nice Guy' from my peers during my last week of High School. I think this boils down to me being approachable and always willing to help people whenever I can.</p>
            <p>Please note, this is just a brief summary of myself and If you would like to contact me to discuss anything more in-depth, please contact me by emailing <a href="mailto:robert.hemingway@live.co.uk">robert.hemingway@live.co.uk</a></p>
